A "good enough" renderer for models in the World of Warcraft formats in TypeScript made with the intent of being customizable and integratable into other applications.

## Credits

A lot of the shader programs and rendering implementation details in this repository come from [Daemon87's WebWowViewerCpp](https://github.com/Deamon87/WebWowViewerCpp) and [NoClip's WoW Rendering](https://github.com/magcius/noclip.website/) without which this project would probably not exist.
